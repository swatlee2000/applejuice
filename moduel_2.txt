Splunk is a software platform that allows you to search, monitor, and analyze machine-generated big data via a Web-style interface
Splunk captures, indexes and correlates real-time data in a searchable repository from which it can generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations

The SmartStore feature provides a way to use remote object stores, such as Amazon S3, to store indexed data. By reducing reliance on local storage, SmartStore allows you to scale compute and storage resources separately, thus improving the efficiency of resource usage.
